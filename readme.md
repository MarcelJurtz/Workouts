# Workouts - Functional Fitness Workout Library

I always had the problem that I was looking for CF-style Workouts to do at home, but wasn't really motivated to sort out any workouts from catalogs by equipment that's available to me. I built this App to build my own catalog of workouts, which I can filter by available equipment.

The app itself is functional, however, the catalog is not that extensive yet.

## Roadmap
* Extend the list of available workouts
* Filter / Blacklist specific excercises, eg. complex / compound barbell movements
* Implement routing to access and share workouts by permalinks
* Add a feature to export workouts as image, also use this to share workouts on instagram
